# AI-Powered Crop Recommendation System

This is a web-based AI application that provides farmers with crop recommendations based on various environmental factors like soil nutrient content, temperature, humidity, pH levels, and rainfall. The system uses machine learning (Random Forest Classifier) to predict the most suitable crop for a given set of agricultural conditions.

## Features
- **AI Model**: Predicts the best crop based on soil and weather data.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Input the required parameters via a clean web interface.
- **Real-time Predictions**: Get crop recommendations based on your input data.
- **Database Storage**: Keeps track of all crop recommendations in a SQLite database.
- **Data Logging**: Saves user inputs and predictions for monitoring and future improvements.

## Stacks Used
- **Frontend**:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript
- **Backend**:
  - Flask (Python)
- **Machine Learning**:
  - scikit-learn (Random Forest Classifier)
  - Pickle (for model serialization)
- **Database**:
  - SQLite (for storing crop recommendations)
- **Deployment**:
  - Render (for hosting the web app)

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Powered-Crop-Recommendation-System.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   First, create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   ```
   Then activate it:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```

   Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser to use the system.

## Process
1. **Model Training**: A Random Forest Classifier is trained using the dataset that contains agricultural data such as soil content (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium), temperature, humidity, pH value, and rainfall. The model predicts the most suitable crop based on these features.

2. **Prediction**: Users input their data (soil nutrients, weather, etc.) via a form. The system uses the trained model to predict the best crop for the given conditions.

3. **Database Integration**: The input and recommendation are stored in an SQLite database to keep track of predictions.

4. **Logging**: All user interactions and important actions (model loading, predictions, and database interactions) are logged for better debugging and monitoring.
